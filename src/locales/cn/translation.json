The tickets collected during one week of the Food Crawl can roll over to other weeks. For example, if you collect one (1) ticket during the first week of September, you can get two (2) more tickets during another week in September to have a total of three (3) tickets. You can now use these three (3) tickets to redeem a local reward from one of our reward partners. <2></2> We’ll select winners for digital giveaway four (4) times throughout the month."

          "answer": "<0>PPE</0>. Please bring and wear your mask at all times when you’re not eating or drinking. We want to encourage more foot traffic in the area, but not at the expense of others’ safety. Your own personal hand sanitizer is recommended, but not required, as many businesses will already have hand sanitizer available for you. <2></2> <0>Cash</0>. Remember to bring cash, since many businesses are cash only. If you forget, refer to our Food Crawl map for ATMs in the Chinatown area. <2></2> <0>Friends and family.</0> Food is always more enjoyable when shared with your loved ones!"
