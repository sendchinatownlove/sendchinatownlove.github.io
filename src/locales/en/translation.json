          "question": "What is the purpose of the Lunar New Year Crawl?",
          "answer": "The goal of this event is to encourage people to explore locally while helping to bring some much needed support to small business owners who need it most.<5/>In 2020, most Chinatowns across the nation noted a large decline in business due to COVID-19 related xenophobia. Beginning as early as January 2020, these communities missed out on significant business from Lunar New Year celebrations, with the majority entering the subsequent lockdowns at a financial deficit that set a dire precedent for the year to come.<5/>Lunar New Year represents one of the most joyous and festive times of year for the Chinatowns across New York City. We hope to keep that spirit alive."
