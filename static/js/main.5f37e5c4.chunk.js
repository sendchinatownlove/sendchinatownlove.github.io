This event highlights 33+ vendors, ranging from gift shops to restaurants, to encourage communities to shop at local Asian-owned businesses in celebration of Lunar New Year! Participants can also shop for their LNY must-haves to prepare for their own celebrations, whether they need decorations or traditional dishes to complete their LNY spread.<5/> Designed to be as flexible as possible, the LNY Crawl is a unique way to discover and interact with amazing shops, restaurants, bakeries, and more in your own backyard!"},{"question":"Which vendors are participating?","answer":"We have 29 vendors ranging from gift shops to restaurants that are spread across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Check out the full list at <4>https://www.sendchinatownlove.com/lny-crawl.html/</4>"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the Lunar New Year Crawl?","answer":"The goal of this event is to encourage people to explore locally while helping to bring some much needed support to small business owners who need it most.<5/>In 2020, most Chinatowns across the nation noted a large decline in business due to COVID-19 related xenophobia. Beginning as early as January 2020, these communities missed out on significant business from Lunar New Year celebrations, with the majority entering the subsequent lockdowns at a financial deficit that set a dire precedent for the year to come.<5/>Lunar New Year represents one of the most joyous and festive times of year for the Chinatowns across New York City. We hope to keep that spirit alive."},{"question":"How can I participate in the LNY Crawl?","answer":"From digital donations to take-out receipts, there are many ways to participate in the Crawl, even if you don\u2019t live in New York! <5/> To make this event as accessible and COVID-safe as possible, you can either: (1) order take-out, (2) order delivery, (3) dine-in where available, or (4) donate to our merchants or our Gift-a-Meal campaigns at <3>www.sendchinatownlove.com</3><5/> Once you\'ve made a purchase, upload or take a picture of your receipt using your <6>Passport to Lunar New Year</6><5/> Collect 3 receipts or provide 3 donations from different vendors to get a raffle ticket! You can use this raffle ticket to enter into one of our giveaway baskets."},{"question":"I didn\u2019t get a receipt / lost my receipt. Can I still log my purchase into my <1>Passport to Lunar New Year? </1>","answer":"Yes! If you don\u2019t have a receipt, you can either: 1) take a screenshot of your purchase on your card statement, or 2) take a picture of your food / item purchase. This is still valid and will count towards earning a raffle ticket for giveaways."},{"question":"I don\u2019t live in NYC but still want to support local businesses. Can I still participate in the LNY Crawl?","answer":"Yes! If you can\u2019t make it to one of our featured vendors, you can donate to any of our initiatives on <3>www.sendchinatownlove.com</3>. You can choose to donate to 1) merchants directly, 2) to a donation pool to have your funds evenly distributed among all our merchants, 3) or to our Gift-A-Meal program, where we work with merchants and local organizations to distribute meals to community members in need. Once you donate, your <1>Passport to Lunar New Year</1> will automatically update with a stamp, which you can collect to earn a raffle ticket to enter into our giveaway baskets.<5/>Be sure to use the same email for both your <1>Passport</1> and your donation(s)! "},{"question":"What do I get for participating?","answer":"Not only will you be supporting local businesses and finding new local favorites, but you\u2019ll also be entering for a chance to win one of our giveaway baskets."},{"question":"How do I enter the giveaway?","answer":"Winners of the giveaways will be drawn at the end of the month (February 2021). Once you collect 3 receipts from different LNY Crawl vendors (or make a donation on Send Chinatown Love\u2019s website), you will earn 1 raffle ticket.
